            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
            Hihi! I'm Chloe. I was born in Austin, Texas, but I spent most of my life in Shanghai, China before going to college (including staying at the same school for 12 years). Like a lot of people, I love travelling and eating good food. But other than that, I always had a lot of hobbies, and some I still keep today are photography (especially birds!) and solving Rubik's cubes.

        <h2>Photography and Birding</h2>
        <p>Birding has taken me around the world and parks just right beside my home. I have seen around 400+ species of birds to this day, and some of my most memorable species (that I've seen) are Collared Scops Owl and the Japanese Paradise Flycatcher.</p>

        <h2>Speedcubing</h2>
        <p>I have been speed-solving Rubik's cubes since I was in middle school, and I've known how to solve one since 2nd grade. Currently, I can solve a 3x3 cube in around 7 seconds and 15 seconds one-handed. I've also written tutorials, competed internationally, posted videos online, been a cubing coach, and created Rubik's cube mosaics. </p>
